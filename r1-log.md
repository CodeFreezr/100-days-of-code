## Log

### R1D1 
My first day was an excurse in understanding the twitter retweet bot from 100DaysOfCode. 

### R1D2
Arrange & setup my 100 Days challenge. And by the way: Imho Coding means Reading. To write excellent code like poetry it is important to read the best code you can get in the area you want to grow.

### R1D3
Today I decide how my 100 day curriculum should look-a-like.

### R1D4
One of my main targets collecting a valuable and reliable golang code corpus. So I can create some SCA Tools, incorporate testing and a streamlined go playground integration.

### R1D5
Day 5 was a more »laborized«-day. It was about walking and failing, content preparing, data cleansing, code experiments with travesing filesystems, thx to filepath.Walk(). Searching and alienating.

### R1D6
Done Clustering of the StdLib, add 4 new gobyes, remove 2. Tried GoReportCard and play around with goplay CLI to get shareable URL's for the go playground.

### R1D7
After repairing the winter-crash of the windows insider upate, now Build 17074, I was able to re-install about the half of my non-microsoft tools. *grr*. But anyway, I could add some really awesome gobyes.

### R1D8
My first week was shaped by building the foundation. Beside digging into sort and and flag go package, I added 23 gobyes repositories and created an additional goby-incubator projects for repos which I want to check before adding to the main. The most exciting discovery today was the world of github badges. After GoReportCard I found the overwhelming shields.io solution.

### R1D9
Slowly swinging into the finishing straight. Main decision for today was to cut out three repos into the incubator and add another six news, mainly from paperback books. Add a smart mini-navbar so you can step from gobye to gobye. Next, greater challenge is to build a central, streamlined navigation structure. This sounds like a bit more direct go coding, finally.

### R1D10
Refactor the folder structure, prepare tagging all the go-files and incroporate some sloc/cloc/ncss calculations.

### R1D11
Struggling with non-forking os-processes in go ...

### R1D12
Solve some gobye challenges with groovy...

### R1D13/14
Just ill. Added some gobyes from Packt. Sorted some to the incubator, and try to get on track again.

### R1D15/16
Still ill. From bed I can just read alot. I investigate a bit in the github pages stuff. You get an absolut free hosting service with just an "git push" publishing process to an [user].github.io/project URL. That's awesome. Drawback: Autopublishing schedulde around every 5 minutes only, and max size is 1GB. So I decide to use gobeys/docs options to split the #golang code corpus from github publishing, not to run in troubles.
