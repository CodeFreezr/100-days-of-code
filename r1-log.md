## Log

### R1D1 
My first day was an excurse in understanding the twitter retweet bot from 100DaysOfCode.

Arrange & setup my 100 Days challenge. And by the way: Imho Coding means Reading. So to write excellent code like poetry it is important to read the best code you can get in the area you want to grow.
