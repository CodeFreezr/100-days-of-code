## Log

### R1D1 
My first day was an excurse in understanding the twitter retweet bot from 100DaysOfCode. 

### R1D2
Arrange & setup my 100 Days challenge. And by the way: Imho Coding means Reading. To write excellent code like poetry it is important to read the best code you can get in the area you want to grow.

### R1D3
Today I decide how my 100 day curriculum should look-a-like.

### R1D4
One of my main targets collecting a valuable and reliable golang code corpus. So I can create some SCA Tools, incorporate testing and a streamlined go playground integration.
